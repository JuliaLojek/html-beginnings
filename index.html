                    Have you ever considered visiting Iceland? Maybe you've been there and would like to know if my experience was different?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent five months on this island. Living, working, travelling, meeting Icelanders and people from all around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also took a huge amount of photos (yes, it is SO beautiful there) and discovered places that weren't crowded at all (which is more and more difficult these days).
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Julia and on this website you can find some useful information about living in Iceland and travelling around this awesome piece of land. I share my experience, photos and recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you'll find here something for yourself. Enjoy! :)
